\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed an obstacle avoidance control for two-wheeled drones considering sideslip based on control barrier functions.
First, we derived the $ ZXY $ Euler angle-based Lagrange equation of them on a wall.

Next, we extended \cite{rodriguez-cortesNewGeometricTrajectory2022} and designed a control law for trajectory tracking of two-wheeled drones on a wall, and proved that the origin of the system is almost globally asymptotically stable.

Furthermore, we designed ECBF-QP for obstacle avoidance and sideslip using control barrier functions, and combined them.

Finally, we confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed control law for two-wheeled drones by numerical simulations.

As a future work, we will compare the $ SE(2) $-based control law for two-wheeled drones in \cite{morteza2017logarithmic} and the trajectory tracking control law in this paper, and consider the solvability conditions of CBF-QP.
