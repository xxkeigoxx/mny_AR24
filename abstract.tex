In this paper, we propose an obstacle avoidance control for two-wheeled drones considering sideslip based on control barrier functions.
First, we derive the Lagrange equation of them on a wall.
Next, we propose a trajectory tracking control law for them and prove that the equilibrium point of the system is almost global asymptotically stable.
Then, we propose an obstacle avoidance control law for them considering sideslip on a wall.
Finally, We confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control law for them by numerical simulations.
